;;; Commentary:

;; See the Spacemacs documentation and FAQs for instructions on how to implement
;; a new layer:
;;
;;   SPC h SPC layers RET
;;
;;
;; Briefly, each package to be installed or configured by this layer should be
;; added to `org-roam-packages'. Then, for each package PACKAGE:
;;
;; - If PACKAGE is not referenced by any other Spacemacs layer, define a
;;   function `org-roam/init-PACKAGE' to load and initialize the package.

;; - Otherwise, PACKAGE is already referenced by another Spacemacs layer, so
;;   define the functions `org-roam/pre-init-PACKAGE' and/or
;;   `org-roam/post-init-PACKAGE' to customize the package as it is loaded.

;;; Code:
(configuration-layer/declare-layers
 '(
   org
   ))

(defconst org-roam-packages
  '(
    (org-roam
     :location (recipe :fetcher github :repo "jethrokuan/org-roam"))
    )
)

(defun org-roam/init-org-roam ()
  (use-package org-roam
    :after org
    :hook
    (after-init . org-roam-mode)
    :custom
    (org-roam-directory "~/roam")
    :init
    (progn
      (spacemacs/declare-prefix "ar" "org-roam")

        "art" 'org-roam-today
        "arf" 'org-roam-find-file
        "arg" 'org-roam-show-graph)
